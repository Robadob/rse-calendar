{% include calendars.html %}

You can subscribe to these calendars in your calendar program.  This
will periodically import the events by polling the URL, so that you
get updates (usually with a few hours of delay).  Most programs
implement this as creating a new calendar which can be toggled on or
off.  Right click on the link above, "Copy link", and then...

- Google calendar: Other calendars (left sidebar) → "+" to add new →
  From URL.
- Outlook web: Add Calendar → Subscribe from web.
- Thunderbird: Left sidebar → Calendar → "+" to add new → On the
  network → This location doesn't require credentials → paste URL →
  ... . Please set to update infrequently.
- Zimbra: "Add new calendar" → "Add external calendar
  (other)", "iCAL Subscription" → Paste URL → ... .
