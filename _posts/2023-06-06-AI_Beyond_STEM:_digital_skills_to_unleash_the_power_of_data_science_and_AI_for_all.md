summary: "AI Beyond STEM: digital skills to unleash the power of data science and AI for all"
description: |
  Hosted by SocRSE Trustee David Beavan, what are the AI skills (and RSEs
  are part of that, right) needed in the big world outside of STEM? This
  online-only panel event will bring together experts from diverse
  backgrounds, including digital humanities, linguistics, zoology, and more,
  to discuss the digital skills that are essential for future success in
  their fields. We will explore the specific challenges and opportunities of
  applying these technologies in non-STEM fields and gather ideas for next
  steps in developing the necessary skills and knowledge. Then it is over to
  you, the audience, to pose questions of the panel and share your
  experiences. 
  - Kaspar Beelen, Technical Lead, Digital Humanities, School of Advanced Studies
  - Mathilde Daussy-Renaudin, Ph.D. Candidate, UCL/Oxford University
  - Lydia France, Research Data Scientist, The Alan Turing Institute
  - Katie Ireland, DigiLab, University of Georgia
