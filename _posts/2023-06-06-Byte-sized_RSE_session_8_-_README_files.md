    In this final session of the first series of byte-sized RSE, we'll look at

of your project directory but a hugely important place for a range of
information that can make or break the success of your project - join us
on Tuesday 6th June to learn more.  

Registration now open - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYbd6vIrL-Irm_DROs74OTEUkT_84PEv12s7UhiBjfuGhGbA/viewform
