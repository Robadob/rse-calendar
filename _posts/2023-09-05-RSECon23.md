  UK-based (at Swansea University) the SocRSE conference. 
  Registrations - both in person and remote - are now open. Members of the
  Society should have received a coupon code for a discount. Contact
  membership@society-rse.org if you don't have it, but are a fully paid-up
  member. Note: This discount also applies to people attending remotely.
  It's worth joining the Society for the in person conference discount
  alone!
  Conference registration is here: https://register.oxfordabstracts.com/event/4430. 
  The Call for Volunteers remains open: https://rsecon23.society-rse.org/volunteers/.

  Also, if you can, please help us find organisations willing to sponsor the
  conference https://rsecon23.society-rse.org/sponsorship-packages-for-rsecon23/ -
  perhaps the very organisation you work for?
