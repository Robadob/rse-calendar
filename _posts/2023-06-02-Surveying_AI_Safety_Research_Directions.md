summary: Surveying AI Safety Research Directions
description: |
    Are you curious about what is going with AI in the media and all the
safety considerations and how one might be able to contribute? Then this
talk is for you! 

Title: Surveying AI Safety Research Directions
Speaker: Dan Hendrycks (Center for AI Safety)
Location: Zoom [https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/84463604528, passcode: DanHEdi23]
RSVP[free]: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/638192339467?aff=ai
Abstract: ML systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new
capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. In
this presentation, I'll give a whirlwind tour of directions in safety,
namely withstanding hazards (“Robustness”), identifying hazards
(“Monitoring”), reducing inherent ML system hazards (“Alignment”).
