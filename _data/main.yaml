      SocRSE trustee Martin O'Reilly will be giving one of the PyData London
      keynotes on 4 June 2023. It will be on the topic of RSEs and similar
      roles, exploring the similarities and differences between these and
      equivalent non-R(esearch) roles and how people can make the transition
      from non-R roles to RSE roles and similar.

      Are you curious about what is going with AI in the media and all the
      safety considerations and how one might be able to contribute? Then this
      talk is for you! 

      Title: Surveying AI Safety Research Directions
      Speaker: Dan Hendrycks (Center for AI Safety)
      Location: Zoom [<https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/84463604528>, passcode: DanHEdi23]
      RSVP[free]: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/638192339467?aff=ai>
      Abstract: ML systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new
      capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. In
      this presentation, I'll give a whirlwind tour of directions in safety,
      namely withstanding hazards (“Robustness”), identifying hazards
      (“Monitoring”), reducing inherent ML system hazards (“Alignment”).

  - summary: "AI Beyond STEM: digital skills to unleash the power of data science and AI for all"
    #id: test1
    description: |
      Hosted by SocRSE Trustee David Beavan, what are the AI skills (and RSEs
      are part of that, right) needed in the big world outside of STEM? This
      online-only panel event will bring together experts from diverse
      backgrounds, including digital humanities, linguistics, zoology, and more,
      to discuss the digital skills that are essential for future success in
      their fields. We will explore the specific challenges and opportunities of
      applying these technologies in non-STEM fields and gather ideas for next
      steps in developing the necessary skills and knowledge. Then it is over to
      you, the audience, to pose questions of the panel and share your
      experiences.

  - summary: "18th HiRSE Seminar - Neil Chue Hong: Can Software Metrics Improve Software Quality?"
    #id: test1
    description: |
      Software quality in computational science and engineering can be interpreted in two ways: does the software implement the algorithm or simulate the phenomenon as expected, and does it perform as expected i.e. does it scale, is it maintainable, is it secure?

      Software metrics are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements based on the analysis of source code. Others, such as those being developed by the CHAOSS initiative, focus on measuring the ability of a project to deliver software that meets various criteria, such as community health or development efficiency.

      A key question is how useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to development in computational science and engineering, which can differ from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear requirements, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures, and focus on performance.

      I will consider which types of software metric might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be identified by considering the differences in the way that software is developed these fields?

    location: The talk will be held online. The connection details will be posted on a variety on channels shortly before the event (see <https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series/2023_06_27-seminar_18.html> for a list).

  - summary: Educating Engineers for Safe AI Workshop (Cambridge)
    description: |
      The Alan Turing Institute, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Cambridge and UCL Universities are organising a series of workshops to discuss Educating Engineers for Safe AI.

      We are seeking participants in this workshop series who are:

      - AI Engineers, Data Scientists, Systems Engineers, ML-Ops, Research Software Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers and more, working in the implementation of AI systems OR
      - Academics and other experts working in areas related to Safe, Ethical, Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence OR
      - Academics and other experts working in professional education, CPD, and related areas, interested in developing materials related to safe AI for professional audiences.
      The workshops consist of two regional nonresidential satellite workshops in Cambridge (4th July) and in Edinburgh (29th June), and a final residential workshop in Newcastle on the 15th and 16th August.

      The purpose of the workshop series is to develop a roadmap toward the creation of a syllabus and set of professional education materials, targeted at software and systems engineers, so that they can be empowered to champion the creation of safe, ethical and trustworthy AI in their workplaces. Developers and engineers, appropriately empowered and skilled, are uniquely placed to ensure that the systems they build are done so according to emerging ethical best practice. These materials will become part of The Turing Way project.

      How to install high-performant software on a High Performance Cluster?

      Software installation on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) is different from the usual software installation on a desktop 
      computer.In order to get the best performance out of the very expensive hardware, it is best to compile software from source, 
      rather than using pre-compiled binaries. This sounds often easier than it actually is. One good example is Basic Linear Algebra 
      Subprograms (BLAS) [1]: A generic installation will only deliver a very low performance. Optimising the compile process will 
      deliver more performance. However, with the sheer amount of different CPUs around, testing it for each new build with a new 
      compiler is time consuming.

      The solution here is to fall back what others have done, improve on it if possible and contribute back to the community.

      One such an example is EasyBuild [2]: software which is installing high-performant scientific software on HPC clusters 
      automatically.

      The talk will take you through an often a bit personally journey of scientific software installation, without too much of technical 
      jargon. It is aimed for scientists who are installing software, or write their own code. Equally, researchers who are more 
      experienced in software installation might learn something new as well.
