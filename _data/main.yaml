      SocRSE trustee Martin O'Reilly will be giving one of the PyData London
      keynotes on 4 June 2023. It will be on the topic of RSEs and similar
      roles, exploring the similarities and differences between these and
      equivalent non-R(esearch) roles and how people can make the transition
      from non-R roles to RSE roles and similar.

      Are you curious about what is going with AI in the media and all the
      safety considerations and how one might be able to contribute? Then this
      talk is for you! 

      Title: Surveying AI Safety Research Directions
      Speaker: Dan Hendrycks (Center for AI Safety)
      Location: Zoom [https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/84463604528, passcode: DanHEdi23]

      Abstract: ML systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new
      capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. In
      this presentation, I'll give a whirlwind tour of directions in safety,
      namely withstanding hazards (“Robustness”), identifying hazards
      (“Monitoring”), reducing inherent ML system hazards (“Alignment”).

      Hosted by SocRSE Trustee David Beavan, what are the AI skills (and RSEs
      are part of that, right) needed in the big world outside of STEM? This
      online-only panel event will bring together experts from diverse
      backgrounds, including digital humanities, linguistics, zoology, and more,
      to discuss the digital skills that are essential for future success in
      their fields. We will explore the specific challenges and opportunities of
      applying these technologies in non-STEM fields and gather ideas for next
      steps in developing the necessary skills and knowledge. Then it is over to
      you, the audience, to pose questions of the panel and share your
      experiences.

      In this final session of the first series of byte-sized RSE, we'll look at
      the humble README file! Not a default and often ignored file in the root
      of your project directory but a hugely important place for a range of
      information that can make or break the success of your project - join us
      on Tuesday 6th June to learn more.  

      Registration now open - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYbd6vIrL-Irm_DROs74OTEUkT_84PEv12s7UhiBjfuGhGbA/viewform
